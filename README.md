# moonlock
It overrides black+gray theme in most browsers
quick tips: Full screen the browser(F11) for less distraction

You can adjust your foreground in `content.js`

NOTE: This extension is meant for reading specially at breezy night
Fork this if you want to add your own toggle

## Usage

Download the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Meiroudii/moonlock.git
```
Then search guides on how to equip a browser extension.

## NOTES
The current config of `moon.css`, in certain sites it'll force pages to turn dark, perhaps that's a feature. It works fine in rust book and that's all matters:)
